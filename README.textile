h1. awesomemarkup â€” generate markup without all the headache.

h2. what's this?

Sometimes, despite all the separation you've done between your behavior and your presentation, you just have to generate some markup in Javascript. Inserting a div here, adding a link there. Usually, that sort of code ends up looking like a big pile of garbage.

Awesomemarkup fixes that! Please see the "project page":http://clint-tseng.github.com/awesomemarkup for more details.

h2. unit tests!

To run them, grab @jasmine-node@ from @npm@, then simply fire off @jasmine-node spec@.
