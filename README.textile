h1. awesomemarkup â€” generate markup without all the headache.

h2. what's this?

Sometimes, despite all the separation you've done between your behavior and your presentation, you just have to generate some markup in Javascript. Inserting a div here, adding a link there. Usually, that sort of code ends up looking like this:

bc. var $elem = $('<div class="loadingSpinner ' + someStr + ' ' + (someBool ? 'active' : '') + '"></div>');

Good luck reading that. By contrast, awesomemarkup lets you write that same block of mishmash like this:

bc. var $elem = $.tag({
  _: 'div',
  class: [
    'loadingSpinner',
    someStr,
    { i: someBool, t: 'active' }
  ]
});

Of course, it does a lot, lot more, too! ...I'll document all that later.
